I'm a med device entrepreneur in training.

I use github as a tool to learn more about tech. It's easy to get lost in hours of exploring, so I try to keep it related to my "why".

In my free time, I invest in entrepreneurship projects. Sounds boring, but I love building businesses. 

My professional bio website is WiP. Thanks for your patience.
