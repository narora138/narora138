I'm a Comp Sci student at the University of Minnesota,

I am excited to use my experience, knowledge, and great work ethic to solve problems by devising new and creative solutions in a full time position.

I have years of experience through different projects such as a 3D printer build and improving an AWS database, where I learned and implemented computer languages such as Python and Node.js along with prototyping skills including soldering, AutoCAD, and trouble shooting.
In addition, I have a range of experiences in different research labs including a neuroscience lab, brain injury lab, and a biomechanics lab, where I gained information in anatomy and physiology, diseases and injuries, best research practices, MATLAB, Python, and segmentation.

I have been deeply involved in Engineering World Health UMN Chapter, where I grew CAD and 3D printing skills, learned about low-resource medical healthcare issues, and gained fundraising skills, interpersonal skills, and grant writing skills.
I spent two months in the Dominican Republic learning technical skills and Spanish, and fixing medical devices in a Dominican Hospital.

My skills:
- 2 years experience with C/C++ and OOP heavy projects
- 2 years experience with AIML using scikit-learn, python, Pandas, and NumPy
- 1 summer experience with database management including Node.js and SQL for web application
- 5 years experience with medical devices
- 3 years experience with GitHub and Git
- Dean's List for past two years
